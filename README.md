# Real-time Head Pose Estimation
this project built depending on 2D Landmarks of the face -neglecting the third dimension-
 
- Landmarks detection using dlib& mediapipe libraries.
- Predicted angles for the head  _Yaw, pitch and Roll_  was done using machine learning models in real time.
- Dataset: AFLW2000 image
